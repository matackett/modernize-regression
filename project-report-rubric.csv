Introduction,"Overall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.",Components of the section are attempted but there are some inaccuracies.,Section is incomplete and/or includes multiple inaccuracies.,Section is largely incomplete and/or includes substantial inaccuracies.
Methodology,"The analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.",Components of the section are attempted but there are some inaccuracies.,Section is incomplete and/or includes multiple inaccuracies.,Section is largely incomplete and/or includes substantial inaccuracies.
Results,"The model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the modelâ€™s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.",Components of the section are attempted but there are some inaccuracies.,Section is incomplete and/or includes multiple inaccuracies.,Section is largely incomplete and/or includes substantial inaccuracies.

Organization + formatting,"The report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages.",Components of the section are attempted but there are some inaccuracies.,Section is incomplete and/or includes multiple inaccuracies.,Section is largely incomplete and/or includes substantial inaccuracies.
